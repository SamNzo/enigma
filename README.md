# Enigma
The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military.

# Installation

Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SamNzo/enigma.git
```

Build enigma:
```
cd enigma
chmod +x make.sh
./make.sh
```

# Usage
The simplest way to use it is:

```
./enigma --message <your message>
```

If no information is provided about the rotors, reflector and plugboard the default configuration is

|  Reflector  |      Left rotor      |  Middle rotor |  Right rotor |
|:-----------:|:--------------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
|      B      |         I AA         |     II A A    |    III A A   |

You can customize it by choosing up to 4 rotors, 1 reflector and 1 plugboard. 

For each rotor you can chose a wiring, ring setting and starting position:

```
./enigma --left-rotor I A A --middle-rotor II A A --right-rotor III A A --reflector B --message <your message>
```

To know which rotors wiring are available: ``./enigma -h rotor``

To know which reflectors wiring are available: ``./enigma -h reflector``

For more information: ``./enigma -h``

If you want to use a specific machine (Wehrmacht, Kriegsmarine):

```
./enigma --wehrmacht --message <your message>
```

For more information about available machines: ``./enigma -h machines``

## Example
To encode the message ``ENIGMA`` using 3 rotors (II, V, VIII) with respective ring settings WAR, starting positions SUN and plugboard A-F, D-G, R-M:

```
./enigma --left-rotor II W S --middle-rotor V A U --right-rotor VIII R N --plugboard AF DG RM --message ENIGMA
```

**Note:** since Enigma is self-reciprocal, to decode the message simply use the configuration used to encode it on the ciphered message

These ressource are helpful to understand how the machine works.

I recommend watching these Numberphile videos in which they explain how the machine works, how it was used during the war and decrypted:
